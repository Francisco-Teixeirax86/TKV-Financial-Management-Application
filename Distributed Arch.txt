Heterogeneous architecture

Leader Nodes: Manage all write operations, orchestrate the consensus process, and distribute updates to follower nodes.

Follower Nodes: Handle read operations primarily, participate in the consensus process, and maintain data replicas.

Arbiter Nodes: Participate in the consensus process to help achieve a majority decision but do not store any data.
